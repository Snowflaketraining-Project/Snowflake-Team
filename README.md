# Snowflake End-to-End Learning & Assessment Repository

## Overview
This repository represents a structured and systematic effort to gain comprehensive, end-to-end expertise in Snowflake.  
It includes hands-on learning exercises, practice implementations, and assessment deliverables designed to reflect real-world Snowflake usage scenarios.

## Team Members
1. Hariharan P  
2. Roshini 
3. Kawin
4. Shrimathi  
5. Shilpa

## Learning Strategy
The learning approach followed a practical, implementation-driven model:
- Concepts were first understood theoretically and then implemented in Snowflake
- Multiple warehouse configurations were tested to evaluate performance and scaling behavior
- Realistic concurrent workloads were simulated to observe Snowflake’s auto-scaling capabilities
- Results were validated using query history, warehouse monitoring, and execution metrics

## Repository Organization
Each team member has a dedicated folder containing:
- SQL scripts and configuration files  
- Execution examples and test queries  
- Screenshots demonstrating behavior and results  
- Supporting documentation and notes  

This structure ensures clear ownership, traceability, and ease of review.

## Tools & Technologies
- Snowflake Data Cloud  
- SQL  
- Data Warehousing
- 
## Conclusion
This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base and assessment submission, demonstrating a strong understanding of Snowflake concepts through hands-on implementation and structured documentation.
